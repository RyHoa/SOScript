# README

This will guide you through installing our four developed analyzers into your internet-connected
instance of Security Onion.

1. Make sure your Security Onion instance is powered on and connected to the internet.
2. Navigate to /home/admin/ if you are not already present in that directory. `cd /home/admin`
3. Clone the 2.4/dev branch of this repository: https://github.com/RyHoa/securityonion (note, you will need SU privilege.)
4. Clone this repository (SOScript) to the same directory.
5. Enter the SOScript directory and run RHscript.sh. `sudo bash RHscript.sh`
6. The script should be complete when you see that so-sensoroni is back online and you have control of the terminal back.
7. Your analyzers are now installed! Refresh your browser and follow this guide on how to use cases and add observables in the web interface:
